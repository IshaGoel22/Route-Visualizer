# Route-Visualizer

Path finding algorithm are the algorithms that are used to find the shortest path or the shortest route between two points. It is a visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms and have configurations to play around with. The major motivation behind this project is that humans tend to remember visual things more than anyother thing. Also this project is a good way to teach ourselves about the various path finding algorithms.
